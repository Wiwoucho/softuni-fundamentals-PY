A group of friends has decided to participate in a game. The first stage of the game is to gather some supplies. They
have a list, and your job is to help them follow it and make the needed calculations.

Write a program that calculates the needed provisions for a quest in the woods.

First, you will receive the days of the adventure, the count of the players, and the group's energy. Afterward, you
will receive provisions for a day for one person:

« Water
* Food

The group calculates how many supplies they'd need for the adventure and takes that much water and food.

Every day they chop wood and lose a certain amount of energy. For each of the days, you are going to receive the
amount of energy lost from chopping wood. The program should end if the energy reaches 0 or less.

Every second day they drink water, which boosts their energy with 5% of their current energy and at the same time
drops their water supplies by 30% of their current water.

Every third day they eat, which reduces their food supplies (all food they have) by the following amount:
{currentFood} / {countOfPeople} and at the same time raises their group's energy by 10%.

The chopping of wood, the drinking of water, and the eating happen in the order above.

If they have enough energy to finish the quest, print the following message:

“You are ready for the quest. You will be left with - {energyLevel} energy!"

If they run out of energy, print the following message and the food and water they were left with before they ran out
of energy:

"You will run out of energy. You will be left with {food} food and {water} water.”
