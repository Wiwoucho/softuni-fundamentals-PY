Problem 2 - Tax Calculator

 

The National Revenue Agency hired you to create software, which will help them to calculate the vehicle taxes.

 

You will be given a string representing vehicles that will be taxed. Each vehicle is separated by ">>", where the first
element is a string representing the car type, the second element is an integer representing the years the tax should

be paid, and the third element is an integer representing the kilometers traveled.
There are three valid types of vehicles:

© "family" - the initial tax for a family car is 50 euros
*  “heavyDuty’ - the initial tax for a heavy-duty is 80 euros
* "sports" - the initial tax for a sports car is 100 euros


 

If the car is not valid print “Invalid car type." and continue to the next vehicle

When calculating tax keep in mind the following rules:

For a family car, the tax declines by 5 euros for every year in use. Also, the tax increases by 12 euros for
every 3000 km. traveled.

* For a heavyDuty car, the tax declines by 8 euros for every year in use. Also, the tax increases by 14 euros for
every 9000 km. traveled.

© For a sports car, the tax declines by 9 euros for every year in use. Also, the tax increase by 18 euros for every
2000 km. Traveled.
